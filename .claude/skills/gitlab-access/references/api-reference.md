## Upload URL Pattern

Uploads in `description` or note `body` appear as:

```markdown
![alt_text](/uploads/<secret_hash>/<filename>)
```

To build the full downloadable URL:

```
https://gitlab.noveogroup.com/<namespace>/<project>/uploads/<secret_hash>/<filename>
```

Example:
- Markdown: `![screenshot](/uploads/6fb7affd82cd01a44240f20961d8fdea/footer_vs_pipeline.png)`
- Full URL: `https://gitlab.noveogroup.com/noveo-internal-tools/ttt-spring/uploads/6fb7affd82cd01a44240f20961d8fdea/footer_vs_pipeline.png`

These URLs require web session auth — see the main SKILL.md for download instructions.
